# Challenge: 

The town of Whosville is looking to create a new public safety application, since their current outdated application is poorly designed and has received extensive negative feedback from the town’s residents. The town is made up of a wide variation of people that are of different backgrounds and ages. As the town grows, the town’s public officials want to have a new app that engages the residents and helps them become more involved with the town and the community. At the present time residents have expressed dissatisfaction with the current application due to the the following issues:<br>
  ● Difficult to use<br>
  ● Difficult to search for relevant information<br>
  ● Lack of rich content<br>
  ● Current content is only relevant to one segment of the town’s population<br>
Whosville public officials would like a new and improved application that utilizes cutting
edge IoT and AI/ML technologies to engage and interact with the residents and get
them more involved and connected to the community. Your task is to design and
develop a working application that will address at least one of the challenges that town
governments currently face.<br>
  ● Please make sure the solution is easy to use and solves a real need.<br>
  ● The solution must have both a working UI and be connected to some sort of
  back-end solution.<br>
  ● You will also want to develop a plan for how you would scale this solution in the
  future.<br>
  ● Don't forget to work on your sales pitch - a successful demo depends on good
  presentation skills!<br>

# AI Chatbot
> Epochs. One Epoch is when an ENTIRE dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network only ONCE. Since one epoch is too big to feed to the computer at once we divide it in several smaller batches. [SAGAR SHARMA](https://towardsdatascience.com/epoch-vs-iterations-vs-batch-size-4dfb9c7ce9c9#:~:text=the%20data%20given.-,Epochs,it%20in%20several%20smaller%20batches.)

![epochs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92131037/179387495-76e8eba0-f1f3-44a9-908d-91fad4aef9e5.gif)

> The chat dataset that is fed into the neural network can be found in the repository's `intents.json` file.

# How to chat?

> Users can begin chatting with our bot either through our home page or in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pMU8hVptH3). When chatting with the bot, you will need to use the prefix ` - ` to initiate communication. We're currently not using a `Command handeler` and our selected prefix makes it optimal for real users to still have a conversation with eachother without the bot interfering. Please note if you do choose to join our discord server to keep AI chat with the respective channels.

# Demo![aichat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92131037/179388942-4c3b1773-3c05-4752-a493-be236473cd3e.gif)

> In this demo, you can see if a user is chatting via web application a `GUEST` icon will appear near their username, but in the Discord appliction (right side) the user will also have a `BOT` icon. This is because we're utilizing the [Discord Widget](https://discord.com/blog/add-the-discord-widget-to-your-site#:~:text=You%20can%20get%20the%20widget,to%20see%20in%20the%20widget.) to mirror the channel on the web application. 

> - You will need a Discord account to use the bot.
